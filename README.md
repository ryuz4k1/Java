# Java

My knowledge about Java.
Java is just tool for us , like a pen.Most important is that how can create a good technology to use Java for humanity.
If you need some codes for Java , you should check , I hope, it will help you.

# Why Java?

The answer is that Java enables users to develop and deploy applications on the Internet for servers, desktop computers, and small hand-
held devices. The future of computing is being profoundly influenced by the Internet, and Java promises to remain a big part of that 
future. 

# Some Infomation about Java

Java is a programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. There are lots of applications and 
websites that will not work unless you have Java installed, and more are created every day. Java is fast, secure, and reliable. From 
laptops to datacenters, game consoles to scientific supercomputers, cell phones to the Internet, Java is everywhere!

# JDK (Java Development Kit)

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the 
Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) 
and other tools needed in Java development.

People new to Java may be confused about whether to use the JRE or the JDK. To run Java applications and applets, simply download the 
JRE. However, to develop Java applications and applets as well as run them, the JDK is needed.

Java developers are initially presented with two JDK tools, java and javac. Both are run from the command prompt. Java source files are 
simple text files saved with an extension of .java. After writing and saving Java source code, the javac compiler is invoked to create 
.class files. Once the .class files are created, the 'java' command can be used to run the java program

# JRE (Java Runtime Enviroment)

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is what you get when you download Java software. The JRE consists of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), 
Java platform core classes, and supporting Java platform libraries. The JRE is the runtime portion of Java software, which is all you 
need 
to run it in your Web browser.

# JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

The Java Virtual Machine is only one aspect of Java software that is involved in web interaction. The Java Virtual Machine is built 
right 
into your Java software download, and helps run Java applications.
